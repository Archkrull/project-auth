# Project Auth API

A combined frontend and backend project to create a site with register-and-login-function with encryptesd passwords and a route which need authorization to see.

## The problem

We have a RESTful API with routes to register, login, and an authenticated endpoint. It also validates the user input when creating a new user.

The frontend has registration form which POSTs to the API to create a new user and the passwords in the database are encrypted with bcrypt.

Tech used: React, Styled components, API, MongoDB, Crypto and Bcrypt
